# Final-project-for-the-Building-AI-course
AI Crew Matcher is an intelligence system that helps match yacht crew with the right boats and positions.  By analyzing skills, certifications, experience and personal preferences, the AI ​​can suggest optimal matches between crew and yacht – saving time and improving recruitment accuracy.
## Background
Finding the right crew for a yacht is often time-consuming and based on subjective assessments. 
Recruitment agencies and yacht owners spend a lot of time reviewing CVs and contacting candidates. 
AI Crew Matcher aims to make the process faster, fairer and more data-driven.
 
Problems the project aims to solve:
* Manual and biased recruitment processes in yachting
* Time loss due to irrelevant applications
* Difficulties in matching candidates with the right type of yacht and team dynamics

Having worked in the yachting industry myself, I have seen how inefficient the current matching system is. 
This idea would make recruitment easier for both crew and employers – and help more people find their place in the industry.

## How is it used?
Yacht companies, recruitment agencies and individual crew members can use the platform. 
Users upload their profiles or yachting requirements, and the system suggests matches with explanations such as: 
“Strong match based on service experience and required certifications.”

The tool can be used as:
* A web-based matching platform 
* An integration with LinkedIn or existing yachting recruitment sites 
* Part of Northwave Yachting’s training platform
* ## Data sources and AI methods
The project may use:
* CV and certificate data from candidates who have given their consent 
* Open databases of marine qualifications 
* Yachting job advertisements

Possible AI methods:
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** to interpret CVs and job advertisements 
* **Recommendation algorithms:** to find the best matches 
* **Supervised learning models:** that improve over time based on feedback from successful matches 

| Technology | Purpose |
| ------- | ------ |
| NLP | Analyze text from CVs and job advertisements |
| Logistic Regression / Random Forest | Predict how good a match is |
| Recommendation system | Suggest top 3 yacht matches for each candidate |

## Challenges
* Data protection and privacy – handling personal information securely 
* Risk of bias in the data – the AI ​​must be fair regardless of gender, nationality or background 
* Small data set at the beginning of the project 
* Difficulty in explaining exactly why the AI ​​made a certain match (transparency)

## Next steps
In the future, the project could:
* Integrate with Northwave Yachting’s courses to recommend missing certificates 
* Include personal analysis via text or short questionnaires 
* Expand to more roles, such as engineers, chefs and captains 

The next step would be to collect anonymized data and build a simple prototype to test how well the matching works.
